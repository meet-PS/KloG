NOTE :

The application is coded purely in Python and related modules.

On starting the application, a prompt opens to select the file where the logged entries are to be dumped. 

Once selected, the application continuosly logs entries and dumps it into the selected file. 

The application runs in the background in order to not make the overall process very obvious.

To stop logging keyboard entries, open Task Manager and kill the process named Klog.exe*32.
